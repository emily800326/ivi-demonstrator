2. Installation

You will need to install node.js and the node package manager (npm) on your
system. Most Linux distributions provide them as packages that you can directly
install using your distribution's package management system. Please refer
to the documentation of your distribution.

You can also directly obtain node.js and npm from http://nodejs.org website.

No further installation is necessary after node.js and npm are installed.


3. Running

Your system must have an active network connection for the AGL Demonstrator
engine to function properly.

Change directory to the "engine" subdirectory. From there execute:

   $ npm start intel-tizen-ivi-engine

This will start the UI engine. Open a web browser and navigate to

   http://localhost:8088/application/com.intel.tizen_homescreen/index.html

This will open the home screen of the demo UI. Alternatively, navigate to

   http://localhost:8088

and click on the "Home Screen" link.


4. Troubleshooting

a) Newer Versions of node.js

The AGL Demonstrator engine has been tested with node.js version 0.8.x.
Newer version of node.js may require you to update the log4js package
in the engine to a newer version. To do so edit the the file

   engine/node_modules/intel-tizen-ivi-engine/package.json

and change the line

  "log4js" : "0.5.5"

to

  "log4js" : "0.6.2"

and then run

  npm install log4js

from the

   engine/node_modules/intel-tizen-ivi-engine

directory.
